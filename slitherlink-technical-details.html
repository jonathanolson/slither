<main>
  <p>
    For this part, I'll use some different terminology that is a bit more mathematically-oriented:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Vertices:</strong> "Dots" where the loop can turn.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Edges:</strong> "Lines" between vertices that may be part of the loop.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Faces:</strong> "Cells" (areas surrounded by edges), with some faces containing numbers indicating the number of edges that must surround them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Board:</strong> The combination of vertices, edges, and faces, that make up the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graphs">planar graph</a> (grid) of the puzzle.
    </li>
  </ul>
</main>
