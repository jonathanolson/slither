- PhET bugginess:
  - How to get text entry (DOM node?) - can we focus it on detecting a click? NO we NEED to pass events through
  - RichText broken somehow... with rollup?
  - Get CAG fixed, using Alpenglow's robust option
    - Get alpenglow into a usable state in phet-lib

- Current code TODOs
  - SimpleVertexState
  - Hard to visualize OPPOSITE colors with... all the noise
    - Better way of HARD showing disconnected opposite colors? 
  - In solver fuzzer --- if it fails validation... CATCH IT, annotate it, update the view, THEN RE-CAUSE THE ERROR
  - A lot of ... solvers aren't clearing their "dirty" state (essentially fully completing the contract of 'do not return the same result twice in a row')
    - We'll want this in order to list out all of the potential hints(!)
  - Could we... have the "solve with engine" button... add to the history, without going forward?
    - Have a "history" bar on left, that shows each action?
      - We WANT RICH TEXT for this... text wrapping...
      - Figure out a "composite" annotation, we'll need it
        - e.g. for showing the "auto-solve" parts of something?
  - OMG... for our hint, we'll actually want to show MULTIPLE actions, all of the ones that lead up to an edge being set?
    - We'll want to minimize the number of actions. From the "end", start going back trying to remove actions, and see if it can deduce the next thing
  - Hint: do better than second-press to apply (switch... text in it?)
  - Actions for face color changes... should potentially specify the faces? Bleh not sure, is tricky how to serialize
    - If they don't... the face color IDs might change.
  - Autosolver should always go "until error detected" (whether our input is valid or not)
    - Just use the validator when we "should" have no errors?
  - If the user changes a non-white edge (ignoring the quick-undo for double tap), we should reset all state except edges (and face values)
    - Create "reset" handlers for each data type
    - Create a global "reset" method to reset all existing state (add to TState?)
  - Serialization of actions.... is a mess. Clean up, so we can serialize them and the stack (undo possible after reload)
  - Switch to ABSwitches (toggle switches) for configurations
    - https://blog.uxtweak.com/checkbox-vs-toggle-switch/ notes they are for "immediate effect" - which they are, checkboxes are delayed effect
  - Move more parts of files out to the top level (hard to find things!)
  - Test Solver Dirty: In fuzzing, check to see whether there is a bug in the "dirty" handling - fresh solver shouldn't solve anything additional
  - TPuzzle improvements (Property is awkward)
  - Rename FaceData => FaceValueData, FaceState => FaceValue?
  - TaggedAction - noting the "required" parts of the pattern, and noting the "changes"
    - So that if we encounter a buggy thing, we can see what it was trying to do
  - HINT button (highlight the thing the next rule would change?)
    - OMG LIGHT THE BUTTON UP AS ENABLED WHEN WE HAVE A HINT
  - Highlight region of "dual color + opposite" on hover?
  - Generation / difficulty [see generation.md]
  - Stronger "white lines" when using face colors?(?) - how to handle UI
  - View modes?
    - Separate toggles for various features? (face color in particular?)
    - Color faces (with uncolored edges?)
      - THIS COULD LOOK COOL!!!
    - Color edges (with only critical faces colored?)
  - Edit modes
    - Edge edit mode (default) 
    - Face link mode (to handle coloring) - different from edge edit mode
      - Or a mode for "edit face values" (and a generate-blank option in generation) to edit a puzzle?
  - Solver that detects "single vertex not-biconnected" cases and prunes
  - Solver that looks at adjacent colors (if we're adjacent to a color and its opposite, it affects the face/vertex/ state)
  - Solver for colors around face states (e.g. spiked 2s)
  - Face Coloring UI
    - Face coloring by value (monochrome?) - give speckled pattern for blank board
      - Slight background color change for each cell (for tilings), based on ... the tactile-js coloring?
        - NO, just use our force-directed style
    - Consider a texture for "inside" and "outside"
    - Allow manual face coloring ... would "drag from one face to another" work? (PAN/ZOOM messed up by that?)
      - Solvers: 
        - OMG --- the mediumfacesolver bit... should work nicely for any geometry? figure out the math 
        - Touching combinations of colors?
        - Ensure I have everything ported from my Scala code regards to solvers, e.g. "MediumFaceColorSolver?" - examine face and coloring around it
  - Face Coloring Solving
    - Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLdZwjs3mzQ to see if there are good tips, also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_xW8n-jzo
  - SHOW the vision working on the image(!)
  - Code cleanup
    - Clean up BasicSquarePuzzle too? Move it to BasicPuzzle?
    - TPuzzle shouldn't have Property... that should be TMutablePuzzle?
      - Maybe just have a TPuzzleProperty? (hmmm) bleh
    - Have TEdge mimic BaseEdge's API, etc. (they define the interface)
  - Settings
    - "Control Center" style
      - Provide quick high-level on-off (ABSwitch?), with "more..." to control details
        - Auto-solver on/off
        - Face coloring on/off
        - ...?
    - Separate appearance from auto-solver settings 
      - Tabs? (from joist? eek)
    - Style preview (demo puzzle)
      - Include animation previews(!) 
  - Improve "line segment ending" and vertex shapes! Give options
    - include white edges and region edges?
  - Bugs
    - Auto rules don't seem to be... working on some of the shape sizes...? (31 in particular?)
  - Aesthetics:
    - Finished appearance: improve somehow?
  - Interface:
    - Possibilities
      - SLICK animation(!)
        - Use Twixt damped animation! 
        - Animate transitions to generation / puzzle start / puzzle end (TransitionNode?)
        - Can we make it more intuitive by having the line animate?
        - Option for no animation, or animation speed
      - Buttons 
        - Add default option that hides "undo-all" and "redo-all" (can be enabled) - don't tend to use them much 
        - RAINBOW COLORS on the buttons
        - Hint button (maybe "add a face value")
        - Zoom (in/out) for help on desktop (e.g. with mouse)
          - Show these only if the control bar is large enough!!
        - Solve button (solve everything as one action, or solve but put each step on stack, OR solve just one action)
          - Will apply "history" state for EACH solve step
          - OR WILL APPLY IT AS ONE THING ---- we might want each
        - Share/export button
          - Puzzle text (faces, faces/edges, in different formats)
          - Image (hey... can we use Alpenglow for the high-quality bits?)
        - Mark/save (for user "exploration")
          - Show "history display" so the forward/backward/ undo/redo/etc. make sense, ESPECIALLY once we have mark
      - Possibly multiple views (one coloring, one vertex?)
        - Or keypress to "view how many remaining" on a face? --- have a momentary button for this in interface?
      - Vertex coloring (e.g. spikes/incident, but also "all of the cases")
      - Loop (around square parity), but also maybe a "loop tool" where if you draw it, it will count automatically.
      - Area coloring (with specific known-inside or known-outside coloring, but also color other multiple-square areas)
        - blue/yellow (from the path tracing demo) for inside/outside default? 
        - ACTUALLY shades of gray? if we are coloring lines. we don't want too much color overload
        - DO MOUSE OVER?
        - Would it... be REALLY pretty to average colors out?
      - Color face values by the number of edges on the face? (a 2-of-3 is different than 2-of-4) - only relevant for certain patterns
      - Line coloring: highlight endpoints/line when over it? (like make the endpoints NOTABLE in case of color similarity)
      - Add config for press styles (but also figure out other input methods - e.g. dragging multiple lines)
        - Hey, how would dragging multiple lines work with pan? EXCLUSIVE SETTING
        - What about "quick double press" for x?
      - If RED on all 4 of a vertex, perhaps we can remove vertex dot?
      - Have PatternExplainers that we can display to show what we can deduce next
      - Have a "solve a single bit" button
      - Allow finger drag to put down multiple lines? (can we reverse back through a line to undo parts?) 
      - IDEALLY we should have a good way for "touch" to input Xs. Maybe a "shift"-equivalent button? 
        - An "inverse" or "X" sticky button at the top? 
      - Vertex interaction (note incident or spike? - or any of possible vertex states?)
        - Allow a "mark save point" (that can be jumped back to)
  - Share URL size:
    - Store "board generation string" on a TBoard
      - Consists generally of "which generator" + "which parameters", but also our scanner will need to output (e.g. square?)
      - Have a specification for this!
    - When we have that, store faces as a simple string (and compress)
      - Also, edges in order, can specify edge state IN A SIMILAR MANNER
    - MINIMIZE the format of boards (so we can stuff custom-boards into fairly short URLs) 
  - import format from https://www.kakuro-online.com/slitherlink/
  - import allow paste of image, https://web.dev/patterns/clipboard/paste-images
  - Rule display (in UI), so we can have a good example of "just display some state" (without input), but potentially allowing animation?
  - Google Analytics (and fix for site? GA4?)
  - Immutable views
    - Would be great for an "explainer" page (this would be fun to write up)
  - Mobile issues:
    - HANDLE the annoyance that is "trying to tap multiple things" while auto-solve is active (and messes with the 2nd action)
    - Don't allow panning outside of the "region" (can go far to left/right on vertical puzzle)
    - Autosolve annoyance on mobile:
      - Prevent user from changing auto-solved edges immediately (?)
      - Autosolve Delay? - (allow for putting in multiple things (e.g. multiple lines) or switching to Xs?)
        - Presumably after a delay, replace the current stack state (with action and simple change) with an autosolved change
        - TAG stack transitions (puzzle snapshot) with what autosolver has been applied
    - On victory, animate to zoom out fully (how to do that)?
    - AnimatedPanZoomListener seems a bit clunky at the start. Faster hook?
  - General issues:
    - Need better face coloring visualization (or ways to find those "loops")
      - "Connected component" visualization? (e.g. all faces that are connected by a black/red)
        - If we stroke/fill this, we'd need to write that "tracing" of outside boundaries (that we'll use for hex)
      - "Seam" visualization? (e.g. lines between connected components)
  - Annotated actions
    - Possibly with the "difficulty" if auto-solve involved
  - Annotated errors
    - Subtype InvalidStateError - for simple ones especially, we can visually report on the issue
  - Autosolver JUST to check for simple errors (or in general)
    - [NEEDS] annotated errors 
    - e.g. toss the action of the SimpleFaceSolver/SimpleVertexSolver, just look for errors thrown
  - Hex "square" line cap makes things confusing, looks off-centered in hexagonal
  - FILE SIZE improvements:
    - If we cut scanURL (and iframe-load it to compute)... we go from gzip 4MB => 0.67MB
    - If we attempt to do a dynamic import (in NewNode):
          TypeError [PLUGIN_ERROR]: [vite:load-fallback] Could not load vite/preload-helper (imported by src/view/NewNode.ts): The argument 'path' must be a string or Uint8Array without null bytes. Received '\x00vite/preload-helper'

  - Exterior UI (improved "new" popup, etc.)
    - We have the puzzle/solver Node
    - TRANSITION swipe animation, like game screens
    - Have tutorial, rules, options, etc.? Better scaffolding
  - AutoSolve rule presets - WHAT IS RELAXING / fun
    - "rules that only set red edges" might be relaxing
  - "Error on startup" detection
    - clear puzzleString first? if not set, clear localStorage?
    - set a flag in localStorage noting that it was cleared (so we can display a message?)
    - force the reload
  - Create "helper" methods for things with interfaces. (Can we add implementation to an interface?)
    - We want to give anything implementing the interfaces multiple helper methods... is that just abstract classes? 
    - TODO: I need to read up more on TypeScript
    - Just... use top level methods for now...?
      - HEY! Put each interface into a file, and then PUT FUNCTIONS THAT USE IT in the same file 
  - FIX puzzle loading, especially on phone (or get some other way of getting puzzles in)
    - Soon we'll be able to... generate puzzles? Get backtracker?
  - Simple Region based edges, OR prefer the raw edges (uncolored)? 
  - Smooth animations between things ... instead of "New", have a main menu?
  - Try VSCode
  - Mobile vs Desktop
    - Settings presets for each?
    - OR detect fingers/mouse and apply different rules for them?
    - BASICALLY just try out both a bunch (phone, touch-pad, mouse)
  - Accessibility
    - Fix up modal a11y, see how it works/looks
    - Let's get accessibility highlights a bit more refined-acceptable looking? 
    - Keyboard
      - Keyboard + Accessibility is first-class? (Could be fast for input on a computer) 
    - Allow selecting a square. Hear its number/sides, manipulate its sides ("space blank, lines on top and left, blank on bottom, x on right")
    - Allow going through a vertical check list box easily?
  - Potentially "animate in" auto-solved things, and clicks don't do anything during the fade in(!)
    - THIS IS ANNOYING ON MOBILE 
    - Or at least have a delay
  - Background behind navbar? (so navbar can have its own transparency?) hmmm
  - Annotated solver actions (to show what happens next) <- omg, what if we animate this? (flash what it sees, then what it does)
    - PUZZLE SOLVING VIDEOS or ANIMATIONS would be really neat!!! - could it put these on YouTube (with text/annotations), people could pause if they don't see/understand?
  - Check when solved - we only have one chain + all numbers satisfied
  - NUMBER ONLY rules (at the start)
    - Most of these would be pattern based. Maybe get pattern solver working first (it's noted above)
  - FAST FAST solver setup for computer backtracking (to determine if a puzzle is valid/unique, useful for scanner)
  - Show puzzle loading progress (and speed it up), mobile is annoyed. Do error detection
  - USE ALPENGLOW??? --- and specify font (we can embed the glyphs no?)
  - Try hex boards (or other shapes) -- actually, this will be useful for testing any "general" solvers, and making sure I've abstracted enough logic?
  - https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/ - PWA this so I can have it on my phone
    - https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile
  - Audio for actions
    - Might help cue on unintended actions
  - Localization / Internationalization
  - Difficulty estimation of puzzles:
    - Should all solvers give the difficulty?
    - Should all solvers be designed to work so they can be re-run without applying the action? YES, right?
    - Should all solve actions - have a "difficulty" rating?
    - Single-level backtrack for "what state can we combine" - if we can't find explicit rules?
  - Allow puzzle export
    - navigator.share(), can share images, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68362603/share-image-via-social-media-from-pwa
    - String formats?
  - [DEFER] Save full PuzzleModel state (serialize actions and stack)
  - Puzzle editor
    - HOW does this integrate with the current board generator? 
    - Delete or manipulate faces from the board (e.g. from board generation)
    - Set values of faces manually
    - Feature to "add in other numbers" based on solver?
  - Board Generation:
    - Consider NumberSpinner instead of NumberControl? 
    - Import from SVG string? 
    - Hide some boards behind "show experimental"? 
    - Add in rotation for tilings/others? integer prop, 0-360 (because people are used to degrees?)
    - Tick marks on sliders?
    - Consistent preview stroke size (prescale?)
    - Instead of our current "radius cutoff", perhaps find a central vertex or face, and measure "adjacency distance" from it!!!
      - Either "within grid", "by centermost vertex", "by centermost face"
    - Allow the user to "save" boards (and name them - see text entry?)
  - Lazy initialization of all of the tiling data?
    - Each tiling can be instantiated
    - Each tiling can just be used to either (a) create all of its polygons, or (b) create polygons to fill bounds
  - Demo videos?:
    - topological view
    - face coloring
  - Improved name:
    - Looperoo?

- Write up:
  - Force-directed graph layout (techniques for planarity?)
  - Force-directed color layout (region and face)

- Rule generation / display
  - SAT solver tweaked for the exact constraints(!!!!) 
  - Show a full explainer (with immutable views of puzzles)
    - !!! Not popular enough to NOT have an explainer. 
    - Link off to full databases of patterns 
  - How can we detect/visualize highlander rules?
  - Show rules with a nice before/after(!) - have the ability to generate that into a Scenery node. Use Display in write-up
  - For many rules, showing the "candiate test-add", "consequences", "thus we can assume this" as the three stages is nice.
  - Grab rules from my discord paster
  - Show the "next rule" that can be applied (and why) - consider TAnnotatedAction?
  - In Rule Description (auto-solver) describe the rule there with images? Possibly animate it?

- Read
  - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34339-2_8 
  - check r/slitherlink for more cases that were explained well!
  - Look up things under https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/search?q=slitherlink

- Solving
  - General:
    - Can we assume uniqueness for the solver specifically? Adjusts techniques we can use
    - If we run through a solver WITHOUT applying changes, we get a list of what it can figure out without going deeper.
  - [from elsehwere, cleanup] Data:
    - SimplifiedVertexState: note if it is incident/spiked --- how does this extend to other grid types (don't try?)?
    - VertexState: (can pretend to be SimplifiedVertexState)
      - Allow empty or every combination of 2 edges
    - Jordan curve around face (possibilities and rules)
    - SAT formats? CNF for edges?
  - Patterns:
    - "Pattern" SOLVER!!! (inspect numbers, identify possible pattern locations that can individually get checked)
      - Each pattern needs to specify the required topology/structure for the area (what is important)
      - FOR EACH topology, many cases we DO NOT CARE how many other edges a vertex supports, as long as they are red.
      - RED EDGES essentially CHANGES the topology
        - Make rules that can be applied to ANY cases 
      - Going off the side of the board is "all x" - Use a way of pattern matching those
    - Pattern (GridPattern?) -- less general than "solver"
      - check( spot: Spot, reversed: bool ): bool - whether it matches and can be applied
        - apply( spot: Spot, reversed: bool ): Action[] - what to do
        - !!! data for the ability to explain the pattern to the user (in a specific case too?)
        - bounds: ???PatternBounds? <---- maybe don't have this?
        - NOTE: can be "extended" patterns, e.g. like extended-2-spike (doesn't need to be fixed and have bounds?)
          - e.g. while vertexstate handles spike 3-2-2-3, we can have a pattern that handles this with just EdgeState
        - NOTE: can be "mechanical/recorded" patterns too (e.g. have a database of these)
        - NOTE: PATTERNS CAN APPLY ACROSS TOPOLOGIES IN MANY CASES
  - FACE (OPTION) STATES
    - How the edges can be arranged around a face - constrained by numbers, but also works for blank faces
    - TODO: rename curreny FaceState to FaceValue, so this can be FaceState?
  - FACE COLORS, and the advanced "how they meet" rules
    - NOTE: determine if there is "internal" things in any "almost loop"
      - Detect case where there is a loop that is almost closed, except it has a single edge OR corner (so we can't enter it)
    - LOOK UP color patterns for vertex or square-loop state. Remember, a spiked 2 will continue colors past it (even though we don't know what edges will be set)
    - OMG OMG look up how we can interact with vertex/edge/face/etc. state with patterns... could discover cool coloring patterns(!)
  - Fundamentally async/await? (e.g. delayed auto-solver in general?) - Or should we synchronous it for simple ones?
    - async/await backtracker, especially between solver bits.
    - NOT IN GENERAL
  - Face values are fairly constant, can inspect up front to determine "WHERE" we can apply certain patterns.
  - "Finder" can find patterns, or use patterns/solvers/combination to solve everything (or to a point).
    - e.g. anything ending in backtrack will "work"
  - Highlander rules (how to we detect more?)
  - Note that if we have a closed loop, path crossings are even, so any adjustment to the loop should also have an even delta
  - OMG OMG solve that "crossing a spiked two" maintains the chain/line
    - SO COLOR IT in the UI! What other cases can we detect that will maintain the link?
  - Refer to things with Jordan curves
    - Different from "enclosing curve"? - how to handle going "corner through vertices" for the "needs 2+" in
      - Can JUST use FaceValue (basic), but also EdgeState (normal) or VertexState (advanced!) or coloring (yes!)
        - For "enclosing", we need to make sure there is content inside and outside. Numbers or edges mean there will be edges.
          - Numbers fully outside, or... hmm 
    - "How to solve the Jordan curve walked a turn around white. Only one can get out through vertices" - think of curves that turn at verties.
  - Jordan curve "corners" that only permit one through (and a closed area that needs 2+)
  - Do have a solver have pseudo-edges and pseudo-faces (marked "outside") around the border?
  - Show the user (for a given puzzle) how much of certain techniques it takes. Estimate difficulty
  - Boolean edge pairs!!! (many cases where we know something will be one of two, e.g. the double-3 pattern) - interacts in fun ways
    - Actually, can factor out to "boolean" sets of edges (black OR red)

- Testing
  - Use seedRandom setup so we can get reproducibility.

- Performance
  - Web workers(!) - particularly for minisat
  - Unassert: https://github.com/unassert-js/rollup-plugin-unassert
  - Avoid animating anything outside-of-viewport?
  - Puzzles are SLOW on mobile, and scrolling is ugly. Perhaps we could use a separate Scenery display for the puzzle, and a separate one for the UI?
  - Assertion removal with unassert isn't... applying much so far. TODO check
    - unassert isn't stripping our assertions!
