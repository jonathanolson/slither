- Reorganize TODOs

- Try out on phone?
  - Seems to load!! 

- Shapes
  - Get topological handling for any shape, but specialize for 4x4 grid
  - Hex! And other planar tilings
  - NO sphere, easier for the graphics/model to not make that generalization right now

- UI
  - Phone interface works nicely (iOS/Android) 
  - Keyboard is first-class? (Could be fast for input on a computer)
  - Display
    - Vertex coloring (e.g. spikes/incident, but also "all of the cases")
    - Loop (around square parity), but also maybe a "loop tool" where if you draw it, it will count automatically.
    - Area coloring (with specific known-inside or known-outside coloring, but also color other multiple-square areas)
      - blue/yellow (from the path tracing demo) for inside/outside default? 
      - ACTUALLY shades of gray? if we are coloring lines. we don't want too much color overload
      - DO MOUSE OVER?
      - Would it... be REALLY pretty to average colors out?
    - Line coloring: highlight endpoints/line when over it? (like make the endpoints NOTABLE in case of color similarity)
    - If RED on all 4 of a vertex, perhaps we can remove vertex dot?
    - Optional BLACK: solid line WHITE: dashed line, RED: no line
      - IF we have this, potentially remove the vertices appearance if they won't have lines through them?
      - DASHES seem like a good appearance for hex
      - !!! This looks really nice
    - Optional: themes(!) control how things are displayed. Not too hard to do. Neon on black is neat
      - For other shapes, displaying the "potential" line looks really helpful
      - Potentially use localStorage for themes?
    - Optional: red x's look ... not great on triangular potentially?
    - SLICK animation(!)
      - Can we make it more intuitive by having the line animate?
      - Option for no animation, or animation speed
    - Themes INCLUDE the animation(!)
      - Show animated "previews/thumbnails" in theme picker
    - Possibly multiple views (one coloring, one vertex?)
  - Puzzle import:
    - vision-based (from image) ==> show better feedback while loading
    - Generated (see generation section)
    - Manual input (also helpful if vision-based doesn't work)
  - Allow puzzle export
    - Image
    - JSON?
    - String
    - URL <--- especially eventually this, so multiple people can play
      - Like YouTube share, have checkbox for "save the puzzle state" - off by default
  - Interaction
    - Allow finger drag to put down multiple lines? (can we reverse back through a line to undo parts?) 
    - IDEALLY we should have a good way for "touch" to input Xs. Maybe a "shift"-equivalent button? 
      - An "inverse" or "X" sticky button at the top? 
    - Vertex interaction (note incident or spike? - or any of possible vertex states?) 
    - "Safety net" - Mistake detection (but only after you've "stabilized"?)
      - Slightly delayed "error" popup, option to turn off 
      - Button to rewind + show error
    - [defer] Chess-like history, with branching?
      - Undo/redo (as a tree ideally)
        - Can show "candidates" explored, that can be clicked on?
      - Allow a "mark save point" (that can be jumped back to)
  - Accessibility
    - Allow selecting a square. Hear its number/sides, manipulate its sides ("space blank, lines on top and left, blank on bottom, x on right")

- TODO: combine this with the section below
- Solving
  - Regions:
    - Ok.... to detect the non-trivial regions...
      - Face color first... we need to get things FROM that.
        - ACTUALLY NO!!! We can detect the "simple loop" types now
    - 
    - !!! When we turn edges from white to red/black, we REFINE existing regions, and CREATE new ones
      - NOT HORRIBLE for processing additional things
    - We COULD scan regions for ALL possible simple paths (and check if they are valid) for simple cases (with not a ton of branching)
    - PROVE things, this is my... intuition. 
    - Region (strict/exclusive): 
      - Two vertices (distinct and unordered) -- can relax "distinct", degenerate region with duplicated vertex and no edges works 
      - Edge set
      - "There will be one (and only one) strongly-connecting chain between the vertices through edges in the edge set"
      - "The final opposite part of the loop goes through none of the edge set"
      - (it will not contain the entire loop)
    - Net (without the "strict" requirement):
      - Two vertices (distinct and unordered)
      - Edge set
      - "There will be one (and only one) strongly-connecting chain between the vertices through edges in the edge set"
      - "NO guarantees about any opposites/duals"
      - (it will not contain the entire loop)
    - Completed region: if its edge set is only black (no white)
    - Final edges: set of edges in the edge set that connect to one of the vertices
    - (~) Dual (!): Same vertices but inverted edges (all other white/black edges not included) is a region
    - Single final edge (for a vertex) => it must be black
      - Removing that edge (and moving the vertex) creates a valid region (if it wasn't the only edge? - see degenerate region) 
    - Subregion: has a subset of edges
      - Means another constriction along the loop, and you know which side has a connection
      - THE INVERSE (intersected with the larger region) gives the connection space!!!
        - It can connect in 2 different ways (for region AZ, subregion BC) 
    - Disjoint: no edges in common (AB and ~AB are disjoint)
    - Oriented: If a region AZ has a subregion BC, it is oriented if we know it will connect A-B and C-Z instead of A-C and B-Z
    - Ordering: Ordered list of disjoint non-degenerate subregions, such that subregion vertices match up (e.g. subregions AB, BC, CD -- for a region AD)
      - In the solved configuration, each subregion will be oriented and ordered
    - Constriction: region + dual region
      - Implies an ordering between the two regions 
    - 
    - A region(constriction) is also... a partition of the set of all of the white/black edges (into two sets)
    - 
    - Region solver goal:
      - Color edges for output? (... how)
      - Rule out "early" closings
      - Bridges in a region are black (duals!)
      - Subregions can net/bridge their way to the larger region
        - Can mark as oriented if "one way" of connecting doesn't work. Then then bridges in nets can be black. 
      - Ordererd regions can net/bridge their way together
      - FAIL if region vertices aren't connected by edge set
      - Region with "disconnected component" from main vertices in edge set is RED
      - Region with "component only connected through one vertex - cut vertex" is RED
    - Region solver inputs:
      - Edges (white/black) - black makes their own regions.
      - Jordan lines/curves (to determine if we have constrictions)
        - Possible that it has no black edges (e.g. jordan curve with vertex construction) 
      - Face (option) state determines if we have a strong connection between two vertices on a face (e.g. spike-2, hex-spiked-3) 
    - 
    - Two regions AB and AB* (same vertices)
      - Either represent the same or different part of the loop
      - If (AB !== AB*) AND (AB !== ~AB*): -- (different partitions)
        - Then there are "four" created potential regions, either we have:
          - (AB^AB*) and (~AB^~AB*) OR
          - (AB^~AB*) and (~AB^AB*)
      - Fail condition if (AB intersect AB*) and (AB intersect ~AB*) are empty
    - Two disjoint regions AB and BC (that share a vertex B) can be combined into AC (edge set union)
      - Implies the dual ~AC
    - Intersections of two regions AB and AB* (same vertices) is defined IF the intersection of final edges is non-empty
    - Subtraction: Region AZ and subregion AB: dual ~AB (intersected with AZ) implies BZ with edge sets (AZ - AB).
    - Region AZ and subregion BC: dual ~BC (intersected with AZ) implies either:
      - Net AB (edge set (AZ-BC)) and net CZ (edge set (AZ-BC))   OR
      - Net AC (edge set (AZ-BC)) and net BZ (edge set (AZ-BC))
    - 
    - Consider for vertices A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H
      - region AE and region CH -- they overlap --- how do we "SPLIT UP" or "COMBINE" these?
      - a constriction might be... in the middle!
      - !!!!!!!!!!!
      - !!!!!!!!!!!
      - We can create the "smallest" and "biggest" (ordered?) regions possible in each case!
        - How does this work for constrictions?
        - Sounds like we'll create 
        - OMG OMG OMG
        - So we manage to create the set of "smallest" regions (since the duals will thus be the "biggest")... 
          - "Standard" operations would make one region smaller while its dual would be made bigger 
        - We essentially have a "fixed set" of white/black edges for any collection
          - So for a region's edge set, we can either specify either a set of edges, or a COMPLEMENT of a set of edges 
    - 
    - Bridge edges:
      - Specifies ordering and orientation(!), cuts it in two effectively 
    - 
    - If we can order two regions, we could try netting to between them?
    - How can we order things with region/subregions?
    - 
    - How would we COLOR region visually?
    - How can we detect the "don't close a region" cases efficiently? Backtracking?
    - 
    - NOTE: can assume the presence of a subregion (for all non-black face values), we can check their net too
      - This applies if all of their white edges are in our region (and at least one of those will be black, but isn't yet)
      - i.e. "does one of those edges need to be black"
      - THEN can take the intersection of nets... no?
    - 
    - If a region AZ has a subregion AB, then ... clearly there exists a subregion BZ, but can we deduce anything about its edges?
      - No guarantee on edges? (unless it is completed)
    - 
    - (!!) If a region has ANY edges that are "graph bridges" (bridges) between the two (region) vertices, then it is black.
      - This is a generalization of the "single final edge (for a vertex)" rule 
    - 
    - Disjoint subregions will eventually be ordered
    - 
    - Any edges in a region that are "removed from consideration" will be red
    - Just like bridge edges, cut-vertex to ... another component will mean that component is red (TODO)
    - BRIDGE EDGE SPECIFIES ORIENTATION AND ORDERING
    - 
    - Any Jordan "cut" (that has two Jordan paths/loops) that crosses precisely 2 edges/vertices (or equivalent) creates a pair of regions
      - A "constriction" 
    - 
    - How does "joining" regions work?
      - (AB) + (BC) = (AC) iff A != C  <--- but best for edge sets if we keep these separated. how can we decompose regions?
      - (AB) + (BC) = full loop (not a region)
    - 
    - Degenerate region: does a single vertex with no edges count?
    - Unit region: two vertices with a single edge (it is black)
    - Spike2 region: two vertices across a 2
    - 
    - HEY we should have a separate option for "auto-solve things that join chains" (since that might give things away?)
    - Vertex pair:
      - Abstraction does NOT require they are endpoints
      - They are not ordered
    - Edge sets:
      - Can exclude red edges
    - Two regions with the same vertex pair:
      - Final state will be two completed regions
      - ... does intersection work?
  - FACE (OPTION) STATES
    - How the edges can be arranged around a face - constrained by numbers, but also works for blank faces
    - TODO: rename curreny FaceState to FaceValue, so this can be FaceState?
  - FACE COLORS, and the advanced "how they meet" rules
    - NOTE: determine if there is "internal" things in any "almost loop"
      - Detect case where there is a loop that is almost closed, except it has a single edge OR corner (so we can't enter it)
    - Create a pointer system (from face-color to face-color?) when things are joined, so we can do quick look-ups?
      - Eventually ends up inside/outside?
    - LOOK UP color patterns for vertex or square-loop state. Remember, a spiked 2 will continue colors past it (even though we don't know what edges will be set)
    - OMG OMG look up how we can interact with vertex/edge/face/etc. state with patterns... could discover cool coloring patterns(!)
  - Fundamentally async/await? (e.g. delayed auto-solver in general?) - Or should we synchronous it for simple ones?
    - async/await backtracker, especially between solver bits.
    - NOT IN GENERAL
  - If we run through a solver WITHOUT applying changes, we get a list of what it can figure out without going deeper.
  - Face values are fairly constant, can inspect up front to determine "WHERE" we can apply certain patterns.
  - Backtrack:
    - Generalize for any "binary toggle" that is feasible. "Edge", "Color", or vertex state might make sense. Maybe "connection" too?
      - For instance, if an area connects 
    - Take a state, pick a white edge, and solve both the red and black case for the edge (could extend to other things)
      - If one fails due to invalid "state", the other is correct
      - If not, optionally look at OTHER state that is the SAME in both versions
        - (basically, look at the changed state for each case, and see if there is overlap) 
    - Could... do other things than toggling an edge. Looking at combinations of edges for faces or vertices. Vertex state
      - OOO or coloring? 
    - Look for the most "fruitful" / changing edges/changes
    - Don’t overfocus on backtrack performance. Don’t tune algo much. It is NP complete. 
      - Focus on fast solutions to human solvable puzzles. Focus on improving “pattern base” to catch things that backtrackers would
    - With backtracking, can apply “faster” solvers in both branches before “slower” ones. Maybe bad for memory, good for early exit?
      - Does this mean we can report the "difficulty" of the next dirty solver? 
  - Pattern solving (GENERALIZE, see below in implementation)
  - "Finder" can find patterns, or use patterns/solvers/combination to solve everything (or to a point).
    - e.g. anything ending in backtrack will "work"
  - Can we write... a RAW solver? To double-check?
  - Highlander rules (how to we detect more?)
  - Note that if we have a closed loop, path crossings are even, so any adjustment to the loop should also have an even delta
  - OMG OMG solve that "crossing a spiked two" maintains the chain/line
    - SO COLOR IT in the UI! What other cases can we detect that will maintain the link?
  - Ensure I have everything ported from my Scala code regards to solvers, e.g. "MediumFaceColorSolver?"
  - Refer to things with Jordan curves
    - Different from "enclosing curve"? - how to handle going "corner through vertices" for the "needs 2+" in
      - Can JUST use FaceValue (basic), but also EdgeState (normal) or VertexState (advanced!) or coloring (yes!)
        - For "enclosing", we need to make sure there is content inside and outside. Numbers or edges mean there will be edges.
          - Numbers fully outside, or... hmm 
    - "How to solve the Jordan curve walked a turn around white. Only one can get out through vertices" - think of curves that turn at verties.
  - Jordan curve "corners" that only permit one through (and a closed area that needs 2+)
  - Do have a solver have pseudo-edges and pseudo-faces (marked "outside") around the border?
  - Boolean SAT, https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gregory/sat/, https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gregory/sat/sat.js, https://jgalenson.github.io/research.js/demos/minisat.html
    - miniSAT looks... nice. Embrace the NP-completeness!
    - How... do we express the loop (only one) constraint? Not easy.
  - Show the user (for a given puzzle) how much of certain techniques it takes. Estimate difficulty
  - Boolean edge pairs!!! (many cases where we know something will be one of two, e.g. the double-3 pattern) - interacts in fun ways
    - Actually, can factor out to "boolean" sets of edges (black OR red)
  - KwonTomLoop threads for ideas:

- Puzzle generation
  - How to... rate? (Make it free obviously) - Give it numeric difficulties instead of just "easy/medium/hard"
  - A very fast puzzle generator would be needed for people (e.g. me) to play for free
  - Try to generate puzzles which have patterns that I should learn
  - Generate different "themes" of puzzles (i.e. we solve uniqueness with different techniques)
    - Find puzzles that need technique A that can't be solved with technique B 

- Rule generation / display
  - Show a full explainer (with immutable views of puzzles)
    - !!! Not popular enough to NOT have an explainer. 
    - Link off to full databases of patterns 
  - How can we detect/visualize highlander rules?
  - Show rules with a nice before/after(!) - have the ability to generate that into a Scenery node. Use Display in write-up
  - For many rules, showing the "candiate test-add", "consequences", "thus we can assume this" as the three stages is nice.
  - Grab rules from my discord paster
  - Show the "next rule" that can be applied (and why) - consider TAnnotatedAction?
  - In Rule Description (auto-solver) describe the rule there with images? Possibly animate it?

- Read
  - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34339-2_8 
  - check r/slitherlink for more cases that were explained well!

- Unassert: https://github.com/unassert-js/rollup-plugin-unassert

- Scan / Vision
  - Use the locations of text-detected numbers to "vote" on what contours to use as a container
    - Start at root. Check each child for how many it contains. Drill down until we have no child with more than the threshold.
    - This approach works well for "completed" or "invalid" puzzles (both of which we'll want to scan)
  - Unit tests
    - Much easier once we have a backtracker so that we can verify things are "uniquely solvable" and that the completion is correct. 
    - !!! Make us compatible with Puppeteer/Playwright, so we can batch-handle scanning/solving (for unit tests)
  - Test with Android, and handle dashed line approach
  - Detect on paper - perspective correction
    - See https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/08/10/opencv-sudoku-solver-and-ocr/ for helpful notes
  - Could use size of numbers to inform "scale" of things
  - Could use FFT for finding scale/grid
  - !!! Get Scenery working with embedding DOM components, like the file input
  - Note "draw interior of large region in background color" to filter out

- Puzzle editor
  - Particularly for things that didn't scan correctly.

- Current code TODOs
  - How to handle the "completed" state for SimpleRegionData? (should we... mark regions as completed loops?)
  - "simple region simple crossing" solver ->>> perhaps we need to solve whether it would be complete with that?
    - Why don't we get code to say "hey would this region solve the puzzle?"
  - Theme options:
    - Simple Region based edges, OR prefer the raw edges (uncolored)? 
    - "dashed lines" for "white" / "blank" lines for "red"
  - Actually.... SAVE PUZZLE STATE in localStorage?
  - Potentially "animate in" auto-solved things, and clicks don't do anything during the fade in(!)
    - THIS IS ANNOYING ON MOBILE 
    - Or at least have a delay 
  - Error indicator?
    - In PuzzleModel, create lastTransitionProperty() - DerivedProperty. Add a "failed auto-solve" field?
      - Would we do similar things for annotations?
      - Add a delay? .... HOW?
  - FACE COLORING!!!! <--- figure out model + make solvers to solve the color state + ones that integrate color into other things
    - Have a "minimum number of colors before showing"? 
  - "Pattern" SOLVER!!! (inspect numbers, identify possible pattern locations that can individually get checked)
    - Each pattern needs to specify the required topology/structure for the area (what is important)
    - FOR EACH topology, many cases we DO NOT CARE how many other edges a vertex supports, as long as they are red.
    - RED EDGES essentially CHANGES the topology
      - Make rules that can be applied to ANY cases 
    - Going off the side of the board is "all x" - Use a way of pattern matching those
  - Annotated solver actions (to show what happens next) <- omg, what if we animate this? (flash what it sees, then what it does)
    - PUZZLE SOLVING VIDEOS or ANIMATIONS would be really neat!!! - could it put these on YouTube (with text/annotations), people could pause if they don't see/understand?
  - Check when solved - we only have one chain + all numbers satisfied
  - NUMBER ONLY rules (at the start)
    - Most of these would be pattern based. Maybe get pattern solver working first (it's noted above)
  - FAST FAST solver setup for computer backtracking (to determine if a puzzle is valid/unique, useful for scanner)
  - Show puzzle loading progress (and speed it up), mobile is annoyed. Do error detection
  - Puzzles are SLOW on mobile, and scrolling is ugly. Perhaps we could use a separate Scenery display for the puzzle, and a separate one for the UI?
  - USE ALPENGLOW??? --- and specify font (we can embed the glyphs no?)
  - Add initial puzzles / puzzle states, so we don't have to image-load all the time
  - Try hex boards (or other shapes) -- actually, this will be useful for testing any "general" solvers, and making sure I've abstracted enough logic?
  - https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/ - PWA this so I can have it on my phone

  - Buttons 
    - RAINBOW COLORS on the buttons
    - "New" button 
      - Replace "Load String" and "Load Image" with one load button, that displays a dialog for loading.
      - IT SHOWS THE VISION WORKING ON THE IMAGE(!)
    - Solve button (solve everything as one action, or solve but put each step on stack, OR solve just one action)
      - Will apply "history" state for EACH solve step
      - OR WILL APPLY IT AS ONE THING ---- we might want each
    - Mark/save (for backtracking)
      - Show "history display" so the forward/backward/ undo/redo/etc. make sense, ESPECIALLY once we have mark 
    - (allow pressing and holding some of the buttons...)

- Concepts
  - "ethereal/fake/ghost" edges/faces/vertices for iterators?
    - Only for SquareSpot? 
  - Separate structure from data
    - "structure" is the topology, faces/vertices/edges/face values - doesn't change while solving
    - "data" is the edge-state, coloring, vertex-state, etc. - changes while solving
  - 
  - Structure
    - Grid
      - "parent" - a grid with fewer "things done" (... why not save that info elsewhere?) 
      - allowsInvalid?
      - "openBorders" - whether the "outside" is treated as white or red
  - Data:
    - Data should be... getters (so we can wrap with thin "if we change this" during backtracking)
      - Thin wrapper checks if our data OVERRIDES data on the "parent" 
    - SimplifiedVertexState: note if it is incident/spiked --- how does this extend to other grid types (don't try?)?
    - VertexState: (can pretend to be SimplifiedVertexState)
      - Allow empty or every combination of 2 edges
    - FaceColor: Inside / Outside / ...others? <--- how do we handle collections of faces and coloring?
      - opposite: FaceColor --- display with opposite hues?
    - Jordan curve around face (possibilities and rules)
    - SAT formats
    - VertexState4:
      - bools: allowEmpty, allowHorizontal, allowVertical, allowNorthwest, allowNortheast, allowSouthwest, allowSoutheast
      - allows( state: EdgeState red/black, dir: CardinalDirection ): bool
      - with/without/booleanops/rotated/etc., see source in Scala
  - Utils:
    - Spot (like an iterator, that basically holds a vertex/half-edge and provides a lot)
      - PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE DATA/GRID?
      - "open" or "closed" boundaries (whether it returns data that is valid or not outside of boundaries).
      - nextLeft, nextRight, previousLeft, previousRight: Spot
    - Spot4 --- allows "ghost" operations, where we are not on a real vertex/edge/face, but it knows the coordinates
      - getEdge( dir: CardinalDirection ): Edge
      - getVertex( dir: CardinalDirection ): Vertex
      - getFace( dir: OrdinalDirection ): Face
      - N/S/E/W edge, vertex
      - NE/SE/SW/NW face
      - turnLeft, turnRight, turnBack, forward(), shiftLeft, shiftRight, shiftBack
  - Solver
    - canAssumeUnique?
    - Ability to "split" computation into awaits, with sleep(0)s, so we can keep our UI thread responsive
      - Can we use... web workers? ---- WEB WORKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - Pattern (GridPattern?) -- less general than "solver"
    - check( spot: Spot, reversed: bool ): bool - whether it matches and can be applied
    - apply( spot: Spot, reversed: bool ): Action[] - what to do
    - !!! data for the ability to explain the pattern to the user (in a specific case too?)
    - bounds: ???PatternBounds? <---- maybe don't have this?
    - shift( rowShift, colShift ): Pattern
    - flipHorizontal/flipVertical/rotate90/rotate180/rotate270: Pattern
    - Have types of patterns:
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState )
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState + SimplifiedVertexState )
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState + VertexState )
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState + LineColor )
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState + FaceColor )
      - ( FaceValue + EdgeState + JordanState )
    - NOTE: can be "extended" patterns, e.g. like extended-2-spike (doesn't need to be fixed and have bounds?)
      - e.g. while vertexstate handles spike 3-2-2-3, we can have a pattern that handles this with just EdgeState
    - NOTE: can be "mechanical/recorded" patterns too (e.g. have a database of these)
    - NOTE: PATTERNS CAN APPLY ACROSS TOPOLOGIES IN MANY CASES
  - Interaction
    - Have PatternErrors that we can display to show conflict
    - Have PatternExplainers that we can display to show what we can deduce next
    - Have a "hint" button
    - Have a "solve a single bit" button
  - Configuration
    - Save in localStorage
  - Immutable views
    - Would be great for an "explainer" page (this would be fun to write up)

- Conceptual notes
  - Structure: vertices/edges/faces and how they connect
  - Board: a group of vertices/edges/faces with a structure
  - Data: mutable info about the structure (face value, edge state, vertex state, coloring, etc.)
  - Board = structure of vertices/edges/faces
  - Puzzle = board + FaceState
  - Delta = action + previous state

- Testing
  - Use seedRandom setup so we can get reproducibility.

- Performance
  - Assertion removal with unassert isn't... applying much so far. TODO check
    - unassert isn't stripping our assertions!
    - See https://github.com/unassert-js/rollup-plugin-unassert and https://github.com/unassert-js/unassert
  - Bit-pack states (especially for square edge/face/etc.) - have a linear array based on logicalCoordinates.
  - Not great performance on: 80x50 ..2223.1...3.2..31..1.0.2.2..2..22..1.32...211.3..23.22232..2.3..2..11..2.2212....1322.2.1..00....1...2..31.11.12..1.1.1.12...0..322.1..1..210..22.2..2.22.1.0..1.11..10.1.....3.22.3.01...22..22111..3..221...3....3..2...11.1.3.3...12.120...2.3.00....2.3..11.1..2.0.21..2..21.0..1.2.2.1.3.110....2.223.32..1...2...1...1311..1..1...33.....3..3..1..2...110..2.0.2.2..121......222212.1.....3..3.0.3.1..2...22..1.1.2.1.1111.1.1.3112........20133.2..3...2.11.311.2....12.....0...02.1.22.1.101....2.2.3.332..1...13..2..32.3....12.0.12.012.131...201..102..321...2.2.0.11..21212.2....1....2123..1.3..0..2.1...1...1....2.....01.2...1....11....3.13.2.1.3...1..0..11...2..2.22.3..2.32..3.1..1.0223.22.22..3.3..1..211.3....3....32....31..0...1.2111.13123.......223..2..21...23....02..1...11..1.012..1.1.0.......1...1..10222.....3.3..2.2..3.2.122.2..1..0.3.213...22.......120...2221.1.321..3..21..11...22.2..0.111.3122.2...2.....211...1.....31..2.223......21.........131.1.2021..112.3..12..1..3.2.22...22..201...0.2........0.2.12..0.3.23.2.111.3.10...12...12.2131..1....3..2..21..212..2...12.2....3.133.2.1112.........211.....1.1..31..1..1.3..22.201..111.2.2..1.1.0..3..0.....11..2..2...2.1.22.23..2....10..1.21.11.......2..3.3...13.2322...31..........1.0.32.2....211..0..21.2.10.2..1..0..2...1..31..2.122..22...3...223.12..31...33...2..1.2..0.20.1.3..1.......0.12.....02...222.23.3.122.2.....23.20...20...1..0..101.32......21..0.03.22130.00..32.31...3..0...11.1..0.2.123.2..13.1....1.20..1.3...21..1.33.32...1...2.1.3...31...22231.131.2...1232..211..223222..22..3.01..1.0..1.....3....1.0.3..2121.21..12..10.2....2.1.132..12..1..2........3.212.....01.1..2..22..1113.1.122..1...21...3.1..121112.3...1..22.2..1323202.2.2.1..13..2...23...2132.32.....2.1.2.2.21.1.12..01.21....1..12......013...20..1212..0..211...3..001.112...11...2.13221..2.23..13..3.1111.1.22.132..........1.22..11...12...1.2..1.01..131.1...21.2...12.2...........12...0.231...2.20.2.1.1..311..2.3..22201.12233..33..1..212.10.12.3.3....3.....21.2....21..2022..3.0..2..0..2.2.2.0.222.1....1..1...1.1.1.........11..0122.2111..02.3..0....1..3.1....2..23...3...2..11.2.112232.2.1..21.232.22.1..11....122.2..21.3.2.2.11121...21.0..1.11.2..13..22.2.1......210131...22.1.10....3.32.2.3210.......2..31.....213.1..12...131...02.12...122.........3.22.1.1..1232.1..1.0.2112..2...32..0.3.2..2.1..1..03..11..32.2..21.....0..11.3.222..1.1112.1.2.21...1.1.2..000...3.2.1....2...32..3.1.....2.2.1.2.3.21210..31...133.2.22...1.2.2.31....1.......1.122...01.1.223..2..1.3.3.220...2.0..221..1..322.12221...2.111.23.2...32.13..2..20..2.10.3.1.......20122..2.3...3..1...20.0...1....1..1.112.2..1.02..2..213..2..2.2.2.0....12..3......22.......31..1...2..1132220..2.12.2...21...3..1212...201...1221...23.3...133..0....2.11.1..3.0.222221.........1.22...22323..10.11...221111.2..1...1.13.211.0..1.1212.231........1.1..2.12.221..2.3.1.2..1.0....1222......2...11.3.......1...232.....2..2.10.0..3.2..21.013.3.3.212...3.1.2..022.2....2.3..0...31..0111...10..11.1.2.21..22..2....1..2.32.1.......1.1...2.13.......22.22...2.1..1.0..1.10.0...1.1102..201111213.12..322.2.2.....2.1..2.3.1...11.32.1...2..1.1.3.0..0.....1.22213...22....2....20...2..3.1.2..1.31310.0.2..1.1......23.223..1..3.12..213.3..1.3...1.0..1....3..2...12.21.13..2.....2....1...30.3.31......1.220.3.2..1.....13..22...0....13......1.21.2..0..23..311..20..33.1...1..312.3.32..2..1.22...3.23222...1.02.20.2....0.21..1.31..0.2..3.12.2.1.1...2.0.1.1..3....3..21....222.1....12112.......02.3..1.2..2213...1...0112..2..23.....1.3..13...011......22...0.2.1..3....112.3..3..1..3...1.2.121.01........2..1.1221....2..3.02.231130..223..2332....2013....10......3.2..22...0..112...2..11...21.1..1.1........2..10.1.3.3.....311.1.......101223...23....222.3..1...3.1.12...12..0...1.3.3...32..112......13..22..32.112..2.1..2.21.02111...2..222.3.0..112.0...33.12.0....1.....1...1323.2..13..2112.21.1222..221.11..23.132..3...3...1..2.........0.1..1.22.10..0..2...1.0....0..2...22.3.3.1.311.2..1..2.2212..1..1..1332223.0.....21..0...3.12

- Maintainability
  - Prettier/eslint
  - At a certain point, cut features and clean clean 
  - Separate out structure.ts into a structure directory
  - Make clean! Document things!
