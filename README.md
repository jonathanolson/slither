Slither
================

Prototype slitherlink-related code, and testing out Vite with PhET code.

`npx vite serve` at the root of the project to start the server, then navigate to the URL (e.g. http://localhost:5173/).

`npx vite build` to build the project (can then be served from the `dist` directory).
