I want to create a Slitherlink interface that explores the limits of Slitherlink solving that works on my phone and desktop.

<h2>What is Slitherlink?</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink">Slitherlink</a> is a logic puzzle where you draw a single
  continuous loop on a grid. The goal is to connect dots without crossing or overlapping, creating a loop that adheres
  to specific rules based on the numbers in some cells.
</p>

<p>
  The loop must satisfy the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The loop cannot cross or touch itself.</li>
  <li>Each numbered cell must have exactly that number of sides in the loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  A <em>valid</em> puzzle consists of a grid of cells with numbers in some of them, such that there is a unique solution.
</p>

<h2>Introduction to Solving</h2>

<p>
  If you're new to Slitherlink, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink">Wikipedia article</a> is a great
  starting point. There are also excellent
  <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/slitherlink/techniques">resources</a> and
  <a href="https://puzzleparasite.blogspot.com/2011/11/slitherlink-pattern-guide_23.html">guides</a> available online.

<h3>Marking X's</h3>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="example">
    <div id="notation-red-x" class="example-div"></div>
    <span class="caption">
      Marked X's where lines cannot go
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  One common technique is to mark cells where lines cannot go with an "X". This helps you visualize where lines must go.
</p>

<h3>Basic Patterns</h3>

<h4>Lines and Dots</h4>

<p>
  Since the loop cannot cross itself, this means each dot will have either <strong>zero or two</strong> lines connected
  to it.
</p>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="example">
    <div id="rule-two-black-to-red" class="example-div"></div>
    <span class="caption">
      Two lines connected to a dot prevent any other lines connecting to that dot.
      <br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When you see the left pattern when solving, you can mark the changes on the right.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="example">
    <div id="rule-two-red-to-black" class="example-div"></div>
    <span class="caption">
      If there is one line connected to a dot, and all other potential lines are marked with an X except for one, that line must be connected.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="example">
    <div id="rule-three-red-to-red" class="example-div"></div>
    <span class="caption">
      If there is only space for one line to connect to a dot, no lines can connect to that dot.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

<h4>Borders are X's</h4>

<p>
  For patterns, it is useful to treat the border of the puzzle as if it extended out and was marked with X's.
  This applies to corners and edges, and is useful for starting a puzzle!
</p>

<div class="examples">
  <div class="example">
    <div style="display: flex; gap: 50px; justify: center; margin: 0 auto;">
      <div id="edge-clipped-puzzle" class="example-flexed-div"></div>
      <div id="edge-red-puzzle" class="example-flexed-div"></div>
    </div>
    <span class="caption">
      The corner on the left is equivalent to the (extended) example on the right by adding X's.
    </span>
  </div>
</div>





<h2>Solving with Edges</h2>

<h2>Solving with Colors</h2>

<h2>Solving with Sectors and Parity</h2>

<h2>Solving with Highlander</h2>

<p>
  Since valid puzzles mut have a single unique solution, <a href="https://kwontomloop.com/forum.php?a=topic&topic_id=66&pg=2">highlander</a> rules ("there can be only one") may apply.
</p>

<h2>Solving with Loops and Regions</h2>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<p>
  For this part, I'll use some different terminology that is a bit more mathematically-oriented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vertices:</strong> "Dots" where the loop can turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edges:</strong> "Lines" between vertices that may be part of the loop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Faces:</strong> "Cells" (areas surrounded by edges), with some faces containing numbers indicating the number of edges that must surround them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Board:</strong> The combination of vertices, edges, and faces, that make up the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graphs">planar graph</a> (grid) of the puzzle.
  </li>
</ul>
