I want to create a Slitherlink interface that explores the limits of Slitherlink solving that works on my phone and desktop.

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink">Slitherlink</a> is a logic puzzle where you draw a single
  continuous loop on a grid. The goal is to connect dots without crossing or overlapping, creating a loop that adheres
  to specific rules based on the numbers in some cells.
</p>

<p>
  I'll use the following mathematics-oriented terminology to describe things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Vertices:</strong> Dots where the loop can turn.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edges:</strong> Lines between vertices that may be part of the loop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Faces:</strong> Areas surrounded by edges, with some faces containing numbers indicating the number of edges that must surround them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The loop must satisfy the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The loop cannot cross or touch itself.</li>
  <li>Each numbered face must have exactly that many edges of the loop around it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Valid puzzles have a single solution, allowing the use of
  <a href="https://kwontomloop.com/forum.php?a=topic&topic_id=66&pg=2">highlander</a> rules ("there can be only one").
</p>

<p>
  Puzzles are a configuration of numbers on a <em>board</em> (originally a grid of squares, but it can be any
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graphs">planar graph</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Note: the terminology I'm using is a bit more mathematically skewed than the typical Slitherlink terminology.

<h2>How is Slitherlink Typically Solved?</h2>

<p>
  If you're new to Slitherlink, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink">Wikipedia article</a> is a great
  starting point. There are also excellent
  <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/slitherlink/techniques">resources</a> and
  <a href="https://puzzleparasite.blogspot.com/2011/11/slitherlink-pattern-guide_23.html">guides</a> available online.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, solvers learn to recognize specific patterns of numbers, lines, and x's that allow them to deduce where
  other lines or x's must go.
